A bot for FreeRice.com, it reads pixels instead of the typical, boring scraping.

-The program uses Robot, which takes control of the mouse.

-Use Chrome, for some reason the color scheme is slightly different then others. (I believe it also needs Windows, not sure)

-Make sure there is nothing around the main square of the screen on your computer.

-You must do the multiplication table subject, and click through the first one. 

-Don't use it too much, I wouldn't want to hurt the actual price of ads on the website.
